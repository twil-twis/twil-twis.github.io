<p>The last words Fennel had heard from her mother were a lie.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to go to VecinaÌ‚. I'll be home before the solstice,&quot; Mvuja had whispered, and given Fennel a trembling hug from within her overcoat, and walked out into the cold night.</p>
<p>And so the solstice, the day supposed to be the most expectant, the most full of possibility, was hollow and dry. Fennel sat on the thatched roof of the carpenters', looking over Lesser Metskjo's modest town square, in the vague hope her mother would be one of the people streaming in or bustling about the carts and stands.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of people in the square. Most of them were Strannic, like Fennel--in fact, most of them were from Lesser Metskjo. There were quite a few Redwest, with their bald heads and strange tatoos, selling spices and artisinal goods not available in Strannef. There were a few Vecinikjot too, a lot fewer than previous years, but still easy to pick out from their striking yellow hair against dark skin. One was chatting with a Strannic woman with a blue apron. Another was unloading something from a cart, like a big wooden crate strapped together with shiny metal, hair hidden under a top hat. Fennel tried to track each one as they walked around, checking and re-checking if they were her mother.</p>
<p>Mvuja hadn't told Fennel what to do if she never returned. Why would she? She always came back on time, sometimes smiling, sometimes haggard and broken. Fennel and her father Astem didn't know what she was doing; Mvuja always just said it was one of her &quot;little secret missions.&quot; Once she came back sobbing, choking out &quot;I can't tell you, I can't, I want to so bad but I can't...&quot; Another time she threw the door open, grabbed sheaths of paper from her pockets, and threw them into the fire, panting. Fennel was very young then, but she still remembered the paper curling and burning, neatly press-written letters falling to ash. But no matter what, Mvuja always returned, often with large amounts of money, never with a word where it came from. <a href="/part1/chapter1/">(... read more ...)</a></p>
