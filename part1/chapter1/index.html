      <p>The last words Fennel had heard from her mother were a lie.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to go to Vecinâ. I'll be home before the solstice,&quot; Mvuja had whispered, and given Fennel a trembling hug from within her overcoat, and walked out into the cold night.</p>
<p>And so the solstice, the day supposed to be the most expectant, the most full of possibility, was hollow and dry. Fennel sat on the thatched roof of the carpenters', looking over Lesser Metskjo's modest town square, in the vague hope her mother would be one of the people streaming in or bustling about the carts and stands.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of people in the square. Most of them were Strannic, like Fennel--in fact, most of them were from Lesser Metskjo. There were quite a few Redwest, with their bald heads and strange tatoos, selling spices and artisinal goods not available in Strannef. There were a few Vecinikjot too, a lot fewer than previous years, but still easy to pick out from their striking yellow hair against dark skin. One was chatting with a Strannic woman with a blue apron. Another was unloading something from a cart, like a big wooden crate strapped together with shiny metal, hair hidden under a top hat. Fennel tried to track each one as they walked around, checking and re-checking if they were her mother.</p>
<p>Mvuja hadn't told Fennel what to do if she never returned. Why would she? She always came back on time, sometimes smiling, sometimes haggard and broken. Fennel and her father Astem didn't know what she was doing; Mvuja always just said it was one of her &quot;little secret missions.&quot; Once she came back sobbing, choking out &quot;I can't tell you, I can't, I want to so bad but I can't...&quot; Another time she threw the door open, grabbed sheaths of paper from her pockets, and threw them into the fire, panting. Fennel was very young then, but she still remembered the paper curling and burning, neatly press-written letters falling to ash. But no matter what, Mvuja always returned, often with large amounts of money, never with a word where it came from.</p>
<p>Someone was waving at her. She blinked. It was her father, gesturing her to come down. Was he angry?</p>
<p>Fennel crawled over to the ladder on the side of the building and climbed down, feeling for each rough rung before taking the next step. Her father was waiting for her at the bottom.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't climb on the roof like that, Fennel,&quot; he said. He didn't seem angry, but almost... bored.</p>
<p>&quot;But you told me to go look for Mom,&quot; Fennel tried.</p>
<p>Astem sighed. &quot;Well, I guess I did. Still, it's dangerous. Keep looking for her, but don't go on any roofs. The varietbo's going to speak soon and I don't want to miss it. And don't talk to strangers, et cetera.&quot; He walked back into the crowd.</p>
<p>Astem was probably trying his best, Fennel thought. Usually he had some dumb joke to cheer her up, or at least something for her to do. But Mvuja's absence was probably hurting him as well, and there was a varietbo around to distract him besides. That was probably the man in the top hat with the box, she realized. Varietbos always had an interesting story to tell, with news and new technology from Vecinâ. It was sort of odd for one to set up something big in the middle of the square like that, though. Usually they parked their cart by the very outskirts of a town, past where anyone else was, waiting for people to come to them. Still, there hadn't been one in a few solstices. Maybe Fennel was misremembering.</p>
<p>Fennel wandered around a little, feeling gray. That was a good word for today. Gray. And hollow. The Sun was out today, but maybe it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>&quot;Attention!&quot; someone called out. &quot;Hello, hi, I am the varietbo. I'm Par- no, actually I'm just The Varietbo. Capital letters. Um... Yes, welcome to this presentingation of an artifice.&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd shifted and turned towards the middle of the square. Fennel clambered onto a crate to get a better look. The man in the top hat from earlier was standing on his cart, patting the top of his crate. It was about three feet square and came up to his chest, made of some dark, splintery wood and held together with copper strips.</p>
<p>He was incredibly young for a varietbo. Fennel imagined them all to be elderly men, with great white beards and great wide laughter, speaking with the ease of decades of practice. This one looked like he had politely waited outside town to finish puberty before entering.</p>
<p>He rubbed the brim of his hat. &quot;So. As a varietbo I understand I'm supposed to have lots of stories and things. I don't have. But, I have this artifice, which is can making-- um, which is to make the ability to tell these stories more. More goodly. Better. It-- It transmits information across large distances. I can draft a message, and via the errekto-artifical mechanics inside, it will be transmitted to my partner's artifice instanteaon-- instantaneounsel-- instantonan-- very fast. It's very fast. And then my partner can send another message back. Like having a conversation with someone across the world!&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd was starting to lose patience with this strange man. Fennel watched as a few people walked out of the square. &quot;Ah, please no,&quot; said the varietbo. &quot;Imagine to this: a world where one of these artifices is at every corner. Right now I understand you must wait for special events to receive news of Vecinâ, so a varietbo can tell you. But with this invention, the news may be here in-stan-taneous-ly.&quot; He snapped his fingers. &quot;Ha. Got it. So! For my first demonstration, a query of where Rnavam is. Rnavam is my partner. We builded these artifices together. Anyways...&quot;</p>
<p>He pressed something on top of the box. A loud click sounded out. He continued pressing and releasing, making more clicks in a sort of strange rhythm. &quot;As I press this switch, mechanics inside the other artifice respond to it. So, Rnavam hears the same sequence and pattern of sound that I input. We have made a rudimentary code to make these patterns mean something, so we can understand. And, soon, we should get a response...&quot; He held one finger in the air expectantly.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. More people milled out of the square, bored and irritated. Fennel stayed put on her box. She trusted the varietbo, somehow.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah... Perhaps he is busy?&quot; offered the varietbo.</p>
<p>&quot;You fraud! Getcher cart outta the square, you waste of space!&quot; someone yelled back.</p>
<p>The varietbo snapped towards the voice, with a sort of polite, scared smile. &quot;I... am awful sorry about this. It should work. Perhaps half an hour is the most I would wait--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This ain't your personal show, kid,&quot; someone else said. &quot;Move to the side, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>The varietbo took a deep breath, and stepped off his cart. The crowd returned to normal as he heaved the crate onto his cart and pulled it to the edge of the square, next to the brightly striped awning of a bakery.</p>
<p>Fennel's awareness returned to herself. She wasn't sure if she liked it that way. It was better to be distracted. She hopped back off her crate and returned to wandering. Focus on the next step, the cobblestones under her feet, the smells of bread and spices and people, the chatter. Someone was playing the flute in the distance.</p>
<p>A minute later, she found herself under the baker's awning, next to the varietbo's cart. Astem was there, speaking with the varietbo. She slipped inside the door and poked her head out. &quot;So, it works by the principles of sympathy?&quot; he was saying.</p>
<p>The varietbo raised an eyebrow. &quot;You believe in sympathy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course. You have a sympathetic link in here to the other box, so actions here are mirrored there.&quot;</p>
<p>The varietbo took a deep breath in. &quot;Rnavamš̗ jei̗ kavte, Strânev <em>maxi̗</em> rupjsv̗...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind. Sympathy is fake and I dislike anyone who pretends it is.&quot; He tapped the top of the box. &quot;No, this works by ... um, I don't know how to say it in Strannic. Errek tu korrekbezk. It means via errek's ... brotherness, maybe. By creating and uncreating an errekva circuit inside, it gives these ... powers and the other artifice...&quot; He made a clasping motion with his hands. &quot;It catches them, and other mechanics make the power bigger and rings a bell inside. So, by pressing the button here, it rings the bell there. And by pressing the button there, it rings the bell here.&quot;</p>
<p>Astem was nodding thoughtfully. Of course he completely understood it, said his wrinkled brow. &quot;So it <em>is</em> sympathy, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; snapped the varietbo, &quot;because this works.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't actually demonstrated that it works.&quot;</p>
<p>The varietbo paused. &quot;Jâ. I can activate the circuit from outside if...&quot; He scrabbled for something inside his coat. &quot;I here have my stylus... and plenty it's hot today for mâna...&quot; He rummaged around the cart. &quot;Hm... Have a thin high-grade copper wire? And Number 8 Standard solder? Or Number 6 with additional pjasekxat maybe also.&quot;</p>
<p>Astem shook his head and walked away.</p>
<p>The varietbo turned back around. &quot;... kjoðv̗,&quot; he muttered towards Astem's back.</p>
<p>Fennel stepped out of the baker's. The varietbo's dark eyes met hers.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah... hello,&quot; the varietbo offered. &quot;I am, very sorry about the failure--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's alright,&quot; said Fennel. &quot;I feel like I should apologize instead... That man is my father.&quot;</p>
<p>The varietbo bit his lip thoughtfully. &quot;Oh. Well then, I was going to say I hope you're nicer than him, but you would have to try awfully hard to be meaner. Doesn't it get hard, being around him all day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot; Fennel didn't remember considering that before. What <em>did</em> she feel like? &quot;Not really? I don't feel sad, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>He rubbed the brim of his hat again. Fennel noticed one side of the hat was much more worn than the other. &quot;Right. Does he always pretend like the ultimate expert for everything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you can't fault him for trying.&quot;</p>
<p>The varietbo sighed deeply. &quot;So. As a varietbo I understand I am supposed to give out big, meaningful life lessons. I am not very good at that. But even I can know and tell you this: there is a big difference from 'trying to know things' and 'having a head so full of shit, it sprays out when he talks.' Either he has exceptionally poor skills with talking, or he doesn't care. Or maybe he enjoys being mean.&quot;</p>
<p>He wasn't allowed to say that! something inside Fennel said. Fennel pushed it aside. &quot;That's not very nice of you either, Mr. Varietbo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um... Jâ. But he was mean first. Anyways, how--&quot;</p>
<p>A bell pinged somewhere. Fennel jumped. The varietbo cocked his head. It pealed again, a bright sound muffled by something.</p>
<p>The varietbo grinned in disbelief. &quot;Rnavamx̗!&quot; He turned towards the crate in his cart. As more bell sounds echoed, Fennel heard they were coming from the box. &quot;Kâvitk̗... seretseniz?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's he saying?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's in a prison.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm asking...&quot; He tapped out the message back, and the bell chimed its pattern back shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;The Seretsbon̗ark want the research. They think it is ... productive and interesting!&quot; He was grinning. &quot;I can stop eating potatoes all day. I hate those things...&quot; Seeing Fennel's confused expression, he added, &quot;They will pay me and Rnavam for this, probably. And I can afford to eat things that aren't boiled potatoes.&quot; More chimes. &quot;He's asking where I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lesser Metskjo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; More clicks and more chimes. A few people from the crowd were watching now. &quot;He said he's in a prison again, for some reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, he got arrested?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No-- Actually from the way he said it I can't absolutely rule out that. But no, he's fine.&quot; The bell sounded again. &quot;Ej, one of the prisoners wants to speak. They ... are new ones. As in they were freshly arrested.&quot;</p>
<p>Some more chimes, a longer pattern this time. &quot;Ah... This prisoner is named Mvuja--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fennel sprang up. &quot;What is she saying!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know! Stop yelling!&quot; snapped the varietbo. &quot;This is hard. She says... she has been arrested for...&quot;</p>
<p>The chimes abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;What did she say!&quot; Fennel trembled out.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah... the message was stopped. I only heard, 'I am arrested for A-N-S-I-V.' That can be an awful lot of words. Why, what's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's--&quot; Oh, she could lie right now. It would be so easy. Even though she never lied-- how could that be true-- &quot;That's my mother's name. She has been missing.&quot;</p>
<p>The varietbo blanched white. &quot;Ah, well,&quot; he stammered. &quot;I am--&quot;</p>
<p>The box chimed again. &quot;What's she--&quot; Fennel cried before remembering she was told to be quiet.</p>
<p>He looked up gravely. &quot;... 'Rnavam's demonstration is now over.'&quot;</p>
